tower-d
This game is a project I decided to do to keep up my engineering chops.  And to have fun.  I wanted to make a game engine from scratch in Javascript and make a Tower Defense game with that engine.  

The engine needs to:
- Run at 60 fps
- Have only 1 Dependency: React
- No external graphics files - all art from code
- Use Canvas to render the game board within the React app
- Work on Desktop and Mobile ( platorm agnostic rendering )

The game needs to:
- Have at least 3 tower types and 6 enemy types
- Be able to upgrade the towers up multiple levels
- Render increasingly difficult enemies


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
